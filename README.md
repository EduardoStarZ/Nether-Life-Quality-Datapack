# Nether-Life-Quality-Datapack


A Datapack that brings some custom recipes, a different loot table and several different piglin trades

To start the datapack, put it in your datapacks folder and do /reload or /datapack enable

To go to the nether and set your spawnpoint do /trigger nether once, and find a good spot
where you'd like to set your new spawnpoint, then do the command again

To see more about the datapack, do /trigger help
